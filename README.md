Healthcare Appointment System allows patients to book doctor appointments online, receive automated reminders, and view clinic locations, while doctors manage schedules efficiently. Built with Python, Firebase, Google Calendar, and Maps APIs for a smart, cloud-based solution.
This repository contains a Healthcare Appointment Management System, a digital platform designed to streamline the process of booking and managing doctor appointments. The system addresses the challenges faced by both patients and healthcare providers in traditional appointment systems, which are often manual, fragmented, and inefficient. Patients frequently experience long waiting times, confusion over available slots, and missed appointments due to lack of reminders, while doctors face difficulty managing schedules and preventing overlapping bookings. This solution aims to eliminate these issues by offering a smart, cloud-based, and user-friendly platform.

The system allows patients to register and log in securely using Firebase Authentication, browse available doctors or clinics, select appointment slots, and confirm bookings online. Doctors can set their availability, approve or cancel appointments, and track upcoming schedules in real time. Each confirmed appointment is stored in Google Firestore, ensuring that patient and doctor data is organized, secure, and easily accessible. The system also integrates Google Calendar API to automatically create events and send reminders, reducing the likelihood of missed appointments. Additionally, Google Maps API is used to provide clinic location guidance, helping patients navigate easily to their appointments.

The project is implemented using Python with either Flask or Streamlit, making it lightweight, modular, and easy to extend. The repository is structured to support further development, including potential integration of AI-based features such as smart doctor recommendations or telemedicine support. The folder structure includes dedicated directories for templates, static assets, configuration files, and database storage, along with a clear separation of front-end and back-end components.

This system is particularly suitable for hackathons, proof-of-concept development, and as a foundation for larger-scale healthcare applications. By leveraging Google’s free technologies and Python, the solution demonstrates a scalable approach to improving patient experience, reducing administrative burden for doctors, and enhancing overall efficiency in healthcare services.
